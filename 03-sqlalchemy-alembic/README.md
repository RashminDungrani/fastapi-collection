# Sqlalchemy-Alembic

Welcome to the Sqlalchemy-Alembic project! This project focuses on learning and utilizing SQLAlchemy and Alembic for database management and migrations, specifically using PostgreSQL as the database backend.

## Introduction

This project aims to explore and understand SQLAlchemy and Alembic, two powerful tools in Python for working with databases. SQLAlchemy is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that provides a high-level interface for interacting with databases, while Alembic is a database migration tool that works seamlessly with SQLAlchemy.

### Why SQLAlchemy and Alembic?

- **SQLAlchemy**: Provides a powerful ORM layer that abstracts database operations into Python objects, making database interactions more intuitive and efficient.

- **Alembic**: Simplifies database schema changes and migrations, allowing for easy versioning and management of database structure changes over time.

## Installation

Before getting started with the project, ensure that PostgreSQL is installed on your system. If you haven't installed PostgreSQL yet, follow the steps below based on your operating system:

## Usage

Refer to the separate [sqlalchemy.md](sqlalchemy.md) and [alembic.md](alembic.md) files for detailed guides on using SQLAlchemy and Alembic, respectively. These guides cover essential concepts, best practices, and example code snippets to help you get started with database management and migrations in your project.
